# Japanese University Entrance Exam Dataset Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset derived from Japanese National University Entrance Examination (センター試験), designed for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational contexts. The dataset includes structured question classifications, answer types, and average student performance scores, allowing for direct comparison between AI models and human test-takers.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple-choice and descriptive questions from past university entrance exams, covering various subjects such as:

- **Physics**
- **Chemistry**
- **Biology**


## Usage

To utilize this dataset:

1. Download the dataset files from this repository.
2. Parse the JSON files for specific subject questions.
3. Use the dataset to evaluate LLMs or for educational research.
